# Ritmio

**Ritmio** is a super simple, open-source **grid-based habit tracker** built with React Native. It helps users maintain daily routines by tracking habits in a visually intuitive grid format — one box per day, one habit at a time.

> 📱 Initially focused on Android, with planned support for iOS and Web in the future.
